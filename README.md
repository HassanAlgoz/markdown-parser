# Markdown Parser
I am just a beginner in this field, who is just exploring what lexing and parsing is about by building my own lexer and parser. The lexer follows the technique presented in [this talk by Rob Pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE) delivered in August 2011 titled: **Lexical Scanning in Go**. The slides are [available here](https://talks.golang.org/2011/lex.slide#1).

I implemented an INI parser in Go using the same technique, so I thought I might as well implement a markdown parser in Javascript as well.

Rob Pike is a Canadian programmer and author. He is best known for his work on **Go** and at **Bell Labs**, where he was a member of the **Unix team** and was involved in the creation of the **Plan 9**, and **UTF-8**.
